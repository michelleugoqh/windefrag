# WinDefrag

WinDefrag is a simple Python program designed to defragment the hard drive on Windows systems. Defragmentation can help improve system speed and file access times by reorganizing fragmented data so that files are stored in contiguous sections of the disk.

## Features

- Simple command-line interface.
- Defragments any specified drive on a Windows system.
- Utilizes Windows' built-in defragmentation tool.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows Operating System (Windows 7 or later)
- Administrative privileges

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `WinDefrag.py` file to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/windefrag.git
```

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Open a command prompt with administrative privileges. You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the start menu, right-clicking on "Command Prompt," and selecting "Run as administrator."

2. Navigate to the directory where `WinDefrag.py` is located.

3. Run the program using Python:

```
python WinDefrag.py
```

4. When prompted, enter the drive letter you wish to defragment (e.g., `C:`). If you just press enter, it will default to the `C:` drive.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you are running the command prompt as an administrator. The program needs administrative privileges to perform defragmentation.
- Check that you are running the script on a Windows system. The defragmentation tool used in this script is specific to Windows.
